# Simple program to determine whether a year is a leap year or not.

# Assign input variables
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# Perform conditional analysis of year
if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print(f"{year} is a leap year")
        else:
            print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is a leap year")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
